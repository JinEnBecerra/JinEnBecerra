# Hello there, this is Elijah 👋

Welcome to my GitHub — a space where I document my journey into data analytics, share projects, and make sense of data through curiosity and consistency.

## 1️⃣ Why this GitHub exists
This GitHub is my learning journal and portfolio.

Here you'll find:
- SQL practice and business questions
- Notes, insights, and reflections from my learning process
- Visualization results, dashboards, and storytelling experiments
- End-to-end data analytics projects

**I'm less focused on perfection and more on showing progress and thinking.
Errors don't discourage me — they spark my curiosity and push me to find answers.**

## 2️⃣ From People-Facing Roles → Data Thinking

My background spans customer service leadership, content analysis, case management, and sales.  
Across these roles, one thing kept showing up: **patterns behind people’s behavior**.

- In customer service, I noticed recurring issues and wondered how to prevent them at scale  
- As a Content Analyst, I worked with structured and unstructured data, focusing on quality, logic, and accuracy  
- In case management, decisions often depended on limited resources, shifting priorities, and potential impact, with each solution being client-centered and tailored to individual needs  
- In sales, performance conversations always came back to numbers, funnels, and trends  

Language learning has also played a significant role in shaping how I think.  
As a native Mandarin speaker, I taught myself English and Spanish to a level that allowed me to work as a bilingual case manager (English & Spanish). I am currently learning French and Italian, driven by a genuine curiosity about language and culture.

Through language learning, I’ve developed a deeper appreciation for how people from different backgrounds interpret information, express needs, and approach problem-solving. This cross-cultural perspective has strengthened my ability to recognize patterns in human behavior — a mindset that naturally complements my growing interest in data analytics.

**Data analytics feels like the natural bridge between my curiosity about people and my desire to make better decisions — and, of course, the hope for a better paycheck.**

I'm intentionally using the time outside my full-time case management role to steadily build the technical skills needed to support this instinct.
